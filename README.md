# rev_space_timeline_texts

The json files contained in the 'raw' directory are a collection of texts bound to specific celestial objects used in this [project](https://github.com/fsImageries/rev_space_timeline_dev).  
These json files are being fetched from the main application and rendered in there.  

If you'd like to add or correct anything in these texts feel free to raise an issue or open a [pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
